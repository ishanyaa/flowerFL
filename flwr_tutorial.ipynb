        "\n",
        "1. **Loading Data**:\n",
        "   - The `load_data()` function generates random data for training and testing.\n",
        "   - Replace this with actual datasets for practical use (e.g., `sklearn.datasets` or other sources).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Simple Model**:\n",
        "   - `SimpleModel` is a basic implementation with randomly initialized weights.\n",
        "   - It includes methods to:\n",
        "     - Get weights (`get_weights`).\n",
        "     - Set weights (`set_weights`).\n",
        "     - Train the model using gradient descent (`fit`).\n",
        "     - Evaluate the model on test data (`evaluate`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Flower Client**:\n",
        "   - The `FlowerClient` class extends `fl.client.NumPyClient` and implements:\n",
        "     - `get_parameters`: Sends the model parameters to the server.\n",
        "     - `set_parameters`: Updates the client model with parameters received from the server.\n",
        "     - `fit`: Trains the model and returns updated parameters, the number of training samples, and metadata.\n",
        "     - `evaluate`: Evaluates the model and sends accuracy and the number of test samples to the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Client Initialization**:\n",
        "   - The `main()` function initializes the client and connects it to the server using the `start_numpy_client()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Server Address**:\n",
        "   - `server_address=\"127.0.0.1:8081\"` specifies the server address and port.\n",
        "   - If running in Colab, ensure the server is accessible, and replace the address if needed.\n",
